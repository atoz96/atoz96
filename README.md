###I’m a senior full-stack engineer with a strong track record of building scalable web applications, APIs, and automation solutions. My work spans modern frontend frameworks (React, Next.js, Vue) and robust backends (Node.js, Python, Django, Flask), with deep experience in API integrations, cloud deployments (AWS, GCP), and performance optimization. I’m equally comfortable debugging complex systems, designing efficient architectures, or rapidly prototyping new features.
